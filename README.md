Certainly! Below are different test cases for the given code. These test cases cover various scenarios, including normal operation, edge cases, and error conditions.

### Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Successful Password Fetch and Store
**Test Case Description**: Verify that the script correctly parses the `AppAudit.log`, generates the correct command, fetches the password, and stores it in the password file.
**Expected Result**: Password is successfully stored in the `EPV_Password.txt` file along with the server name.

#### Test Case 2: AppAudit.log File Not Found
**Test Case Description**: Verify the script's behavior when the `AppAudit.log` file is not found at the specified location.
**Expected Result**: The script should raise a `FileNotFoundError` and print an appropriate error message.

#### Test Case 3: Invalid Log Format
**Test Case Description**: Verify the script's behavior when the `AppAudit.log` file does not match the expected format.
**Expected Result**: The script should print "Failed to parse AppAudit.log" and not proceed further.

#### Test Case 4: Command Execution Fails
**Test Case Description**: Verify the script's behavior when the command execution in CMD does not produce the expected output.
**Expected Result**: The script should print "Failed to retrieve password from the command output" and not proceed further.

#### Test Case 5: Password File Less Than 8 Entries
**Test Case Description**: Verify that the script correctly stores the password when the `EPV_Password.txt` file has fewer than 8 entries.
**Expected Result**: Password is appended to the `EPV_Password.txt` file without generating a report.

#### Test Case 6: Password File Reaches 8 Entries with Matching Passwords
**Test Case Description**: Verify that the script correctly generates a report when the `EPV_Password.txt` file reaches 8 entries, and all passwords match.
**Expected Result**: A report is generated stating that all server passwords match, and the `EPV_Password.txt` file is cleared.

#### Test Case 7: Password File Reaches 8 Entries with Mismatched Passwords
**Test Case Description**: Verify that the script correctly generates a report when the `EPV_Password.txt` file reaches 8 entries, and there are mismatched passwords.
**Expected Result**: A report is generated listing the server names with mismatched passwords, and the `EPV_Password.txt` file is cleared.

#### Test Case 8: Empty Password File
**Test Case Description**: Verify the script's behavior when the `EPV_Password.txt` file is initially empty.
**Expected Result**: Password is successfully stored in the `EPV_Password.txt` file along with the server name.

#### Test Case 9: Report Generation Includes Date and Time
**Test Case Description**: Verify that the generated report includes the date and time when it was generated.
**Expected Result**: The report contains the current date and time in the specified format.

#### Test Case 10: Command Output with Less Than Two Lines
**Test Case Description**: Verify the script's behavior when the command output in CMD has fewer than two lines.
**Expected Result**: The script should print "Failed to retrieve password from the command output" and not proceed further.

#### Test Case 11: Command Execution with Special Characters in Password
**Test Case Description**: Verify the script's behavior when the command output includes special characters in the password.
**Expected Result**: Password with special characters is successfully stored and compared.

### Summary of Test Cases

1. **Successful Password Fetch and Store**: Password is correctly stored.
2. **AppAudit.log File Not Found**: Raises `FileNotFoundError`.
3. **Invalid Log Format**: Prints parsing failure message.
4. **Command Execution Fails**: Prints command execution failure message.
5. **Password File Less Than 8 Entries**: Password appended without report.
6. **Password File Reaches 8 Entries with Matching Passwords**: Generates matching passwords report.
7. **Password File Reaches 8 Entries with Mismatched Passwords**: Generates mismatched passwords report.
8. **Empty Password File**: Password successfully stored.
9. **Report Generation Includes Date and Time**: Report contains date and time.
10. **Command Output with Less Than Two Lines**: Prints command output failure message.
11. **Command Execution with Special Characters in Password**: Password with special characters stored and compared.

These test cases provide comprehensive coverage of the scriptâ€™s functionality and handle various edge cases and error scenarios.
